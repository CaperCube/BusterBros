## Hosting a server:

Here's some beginner / intermediate level instructions to get this bot up and running:

1. Install dev environment (I like VSCode)
2. Install Node.js on your system
3. Create a directory on your system and put the contents of the project here
4. Open VSCode and use *File > Open Folder...* to open this folder
5. Click *Terminal > New Terminal*
6. Run the command `npm init` and take note of the app entry name (i.e. `index.js`), make sure it matches the js file in the root folder of the project
7. Run the command `npm install` in the terminal to install the project's node packages
8. Type `node .` in the terminal, and hit enter to start the server
9. To connect to the game, open a browser and type in your IP address followed by the port the server's running from (example: 192.168.0.1:8080)
10. Close VSCode or click in the terminal and press `Ctrl + c` to stop the bot
